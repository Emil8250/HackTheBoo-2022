1. I opened the capture.pcap file in Wireshark.
2. I clicked on Statistics --> Protocol Hierarchy and saw that there was some data packages. I right clicked the data packages and chose apply as filter.
3. I right clicked the first package and chose Follow --> TCP Stram
4. I noticed something in the data that looked like a base64 string: "==gC9FSI5tGMwA3cfRjd0o2Xz0GNjNjYfR3c1p2Xn5WMyBXNfRjd0o2eCRFS" | rev
5. Reversing it and converting it to ascii showed the flag: echo "==gC9FSI5tGMwA3cfRjd0o2Xz0GNjNjYfR3c1p2Xn5WMyBXNfRjd0o2eCRFS" | rev | base64 -d
